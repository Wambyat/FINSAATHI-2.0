The SAATHI Financial Literacy website is an educational platform tailored for individuals with limited formal education and financial knowledge. Its primary purpose is to empower users by providing accessible resources that help them manage their finances effectively, make informed decisions, and work toward financial stability. The platform is designed to simplify complex financial concepts, making them understandable for those who may not have access to traditional financial education. Through interactive content and practical guidance, SAATHI aims to bridge the financial literacy gap and support users in achieving greater financial independence and security.
Languages Supported: English, Hindi and various other regional languages.

We have used the following technologies to build the website:

- Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Tailwind, ReactJS
- Backend: NodeJS, ExpressJS, MongoDB
- Deployment: Vercel

> [!CAUTION]
> The vercel deployment **DOES NOT
** have the express server included. The backend is not deployed on vercel. It should be updated to include the backend as well.
